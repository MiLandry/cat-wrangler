# cat_wrangler




A mobile app that can facilitate users to create and orchestrate events and gatherings amongst friends, with features to request rsvps, statuses, supplies, and to contact attendees.

## Get Started



Install the client project dependencies:



```bash

npm install

```



Run the client project:



```bash

npm start

```



The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.



Visit [`http://localhost:4040/`](http://localhost:4040/) to access the starter application.

### Hot restart

Hot restart is supported with AS, by clicking playbutton. I don't think reload is supported



## web

web dev does not work, plugins assume that an android or ios sdk exists



problem is that oauth solution does not work like this




Live reload: Not available with web development

Hot Server reload: press r in shell to reload

`flutter run -d chrome`



TODO



extract useful stuff from https://flutter.github.io/samples/#

Automate API SDK, blocked by using windows, will want unix like to do correctly : https://vvsevolodovich.dev/working-with-openapi-in-flutter-fully-automatically/






flutter has this really stupid thing of needing the dev to generate 'g' code (flutter byte code??) TODO make computer 'watch' and auto 'build'







`npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i cat.yaml -g dart-dio -o api/`



run this in API



`pub run build_runner build`



note there is no flutter in this
